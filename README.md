# ENM Watcher

This is a simple web scraping app written in Rust. It watches the Ecole Nationale de la Magistrature webpage for any changes in the exam results list, to warn the user when the results are out.

This can be used as an example for doing web scraping in Rust.

Note : this was made for the 2022 version of the site.
